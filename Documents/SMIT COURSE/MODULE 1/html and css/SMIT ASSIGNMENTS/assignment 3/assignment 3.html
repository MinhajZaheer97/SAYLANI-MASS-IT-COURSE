        Muhammad Iqbal was a renowned philosopher, poet, and politician in British India who is widely regarded as the 
        spiritual father of Pakistan. Born on November 9, 1877, in Sialkot, he was a visionary thinker who used his poetry, primarily
         in Persian and Urdu, to inspire Muslims across the Indian subcontinent. Iqbal's ideas emphasized self-awareness, unity, and the 
         revival of Islamic values, and he played a pivotal role in conceptualizing the idea of a separate nation for Muslims, which later
          led to the creation of Pakistan in 1947. His famous works include 

          <em><b><q>Bang-e-Dra, Asrar-e-Khudi, and Payam-e-Mashriq</q></b></em>. 

          He passed away on April 21, 1938, but remains a celebrated national hero in Pakistan.
